- ðŸ‘‹ Hewwo, Iâ€™m @TheoWarmindsWrath, your local French Furry IT person.
- Introverted and shy but a lovely folk.
- Iâ€™m interested in doing mods and see what cataclysmic ideas I can make on a whim.
- Currently modding on Stellaris and doing some basic Blender modelling, and will at one point turn to Space Engineers and Subnautica as-well.
- Here's where to reach me : on Discord as "theowarmindswrath"
- Pronouns: Any and all as I'm Agender, have fun!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've got ADHD and Autism, so chaos is my religion!
