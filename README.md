- ðŸ‘‹ Hewwo! Iâ€™m @TheoWarmindsWrath, your local IT person dwelling the internet.
- Am rather introverted 'n' shy but rather friendly when I get to know others.
- I like doing mods and see what cataclysmic things I can make on a whim.
- Currently modding on Stellaris and doing some basic Blender modelling for my own fun.
- Here's how to reach me on Discord : "theowarmindswrath"
- Pronouns are any and all, take your poison and own it!
- âš¡ Fact: I've got ADHD and Autism, am chaotic, Mechanicus be my religion!
