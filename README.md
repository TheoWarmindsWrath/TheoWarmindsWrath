- ðŸ‘‹ Greetings, Iâ€™m @TheoWarmindsWrath, your local French Furry IT person.
- Iâ€™m interested in doing a few mods and see what stupid idea I can make possible.
- Iâ€™m currently learning modding on Stellaris and doing some basic Blender modelling, and will at one point start for Space Engineers and Subnautica as-well
- How to reach me : on Discord as "theowarmindswrath"
- Pronouns: Any and all as I'm Agender, have fun!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am insane and efficient, prepare for Chaos!
